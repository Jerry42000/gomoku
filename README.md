# Gomoku AI (8×8) — Simple Heuristic Engine in Python

When you play a board game app against “the computer,” a lightweight engine evaluates many legal moves and picks the one that looks best right now. This project is exactly that for Gomoku on an 8×8 board: a small, readable AI that scores patterns (open / semi-open / closed lines of stones) and chooses the move that maximizes that score. The game alternates Black (computer) and White (you); five in a row wins.
